I am a Linux, FOSS, Networking, Hardware and Privacy enthusiast üïµÔ∏è. From building custom PCs üñ•Ô∏è (Workstations for CAD, Video Editing and Gaming) to tinkering with RaspberryPis ü´ê and Linux Distributions üêß.</br>
</br>
My mosts recents projects were:</br>
Upgrading my Home Network to the next level with a Recursive DNS (Unbound), Domain/Tracker Blocker & DHCP (PiHole), my own personal Home VPN, Media Server and Cloud Storage. And to top it of, reverse proxies with nginx for easy access.</br>
</br>
Future Planed Projects:</br>
Setting up a PfSense Router and upgrading my Media Server & Cloud Storage to a QNAP with TrueNAS (RAIDZ) or a Zigma Board with Open Media Vault and Casa OS with Seagate EXOS HDDs.


Feel free to *[contact](#contact)* üó£Ô∏è me directly.
