I am a Linux, FOSS, Networking, Hardware and Privacy enthusiast 🕵️. From building custom PCs 🖥️ (Workstations for CAD, Video Editing and Gaming) to tinkering with RaspberryPis 🫐 and Linux Distributions 🐧. 
My mosts recents projects were: Upgrading my Home Network to the next level with a Recursive DNS (Unbound), Domain/Tracker Blocker & DHCP (PiHole), my own personal Home VPN, Media Server and Cloud Storage. And to top it of, reverse proxies with nginx for easy access.

Future Planed Projects: Setting up a PfSense Router and upgrading my Media Server & Cloud Storage to a QNAP with TrueNAS (RAIDZ) or a Zigma Board with Open Media Vault and Casa OS
